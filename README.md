# EuroScope: Predictive Travel Intelligence for Europe

EuroScope is a data science and machine learning project designed to forecast travel demand, pricing trends, and accommodation costs across major European destinations. Using multi-source datasets including Airbnb listings, flight prices, and cost-of-living indicators, this project provides insights and predictive models that support pricing optimization, revenue management, and market analysis.

## Project Highlights
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Machine Learning models (RandomForest & XGBoost)  
- Visualizations and insights  
- Fully reproducible Jupyter notebooks  

This repository is ideal for showcasing data analysis, ML modeling, and end-to-end pipeline development—especially for roles at Meta, Amazon, SAP, Booking.com, UBS, and similar companies.
